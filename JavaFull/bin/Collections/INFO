                  e[3]=new User();// its hold only Homogenous not allowed heterogenous
         
         Array is an fixed in size we cant change the size of the array
         Array hold only homogenouus 
         Arrays can hold primitive and object
         
         Using collection and object we can hold heterogenous eleemnts
