Excetion Handling:-
                   java code terminate the program abnormally
                   it is an event which occurs during the program exicution that event distrub the normal flow of exicution
                                  THROWABLE

Error:-its caused ;lack system resources

EXCEPTION HANDLING FUNDAMENTALS:-
                                TRY
                                CATCH
                                FINALLY
                                THROW
                                THROWS

 Various methods to print Exception information:-
                                                  printstackTrace()--get full information
                                                  toString()
                                                  getMessage()

   TWO TYPES OF COMPILER THROWING EXCEPTIOns
1.Checked Compiler==checked by compiler
                   == all input output excetions are checked exceptions
2.Unchecked Compiler==unchecked by compiler
                     ==All runtime exceptions are unchecked exceptyions



                     THROW:-
                         to create exception object manually and handover the java jbm

                     Throws:-its is unchecked exception
                             handover the throw object using Throws Keyword
